Using tools like deno-npm and deno_npm to use npm packages in Deno may introduce some inefficiencies compared to using native Deno modules. These tools work by resolving the dependencies of the npm packages and generating a Deno-compatible module map, which can add additional overhead to the module loading process. In addition, using third-party tools like these may introduce additional dependencies and complexity to your project, which can make it more difficult to understand and maintain.

Many npm packages have been adapted to work with Deno directly, either through direct porting or by using a compatibility layer. In many cases, it may be more efficient and straightforward to use a native Deno module instead of a jerry-rigged workaround.

While tools like specificers, CDNs and adapters may be a good option. Using native Deno modules, or limiting to a few npm packages, may be more efficient and straightforward.

# How to turn an npm module to a package adapted for deno

1. Make sure that the package does not have any dependencies that are not compatible with Deno. Some npm packages may have dependencies that are specific to Node.js or that use features that are not supported by Deno. If the package has such dependencies, you will need to either replace them with Deno-compatible alternatives or 

* Replace the dependency with a Deno-compatible alternative. In some cases, you may be able to find a Deno-compatible library that provides similar functionality to the npm package dependency. For example, if the npm package depends on the request library, you could try using the isomorphic-fetch library instead, which provides a Deno-compatible implementation of the fetch API.

* Port the dependency to Deno. If there is no Deno-compatible alternative to the npm package dependency, you may need to port the dependency to Deno yourself. This can involve modifying the dependency's code to use Deno APIs and features, and possibly writing additional code to adapt the dependency to Deno.

* Use a compatibility layer. In some cases, you may be able to use a compatibility layer like esm or ts-node to "translate" the npm package dependency to Deno. These tools can allow you to use npm packages that are not natively compatible with Deno, by providing a shim that emulates the Node.js runtime environment. However, using a compatibility layer can add additional overhead and complexity to your project, and may not always be a feasible option.

2. Modify the package's code to use Deno APIs and features instead of Node.js-specific APIs. This may involve replacing calls to Node.js APIs with equivalent Deno APIs, or adapting the code to use Deno's built-in types and functionality.

* Look for calls to functions like require, process, or Buffer, which are specific to Node.js.

* Determine what the Node.js APIs are being used for, file system access, networking, concurrency, or some other purpose? Understanding the purpose of the APIs will help you determine what Deno APIs or functionality to use as a replacement.

* Find the equivalent Deno APIs or functionality. The Deno documentation is a good resource for finding Deno APIs that are equivalent to Node.js APIs. You can also search online or ask for help in Deno-specific forums or communities.

* Modify the code to use the equivalent Deno APIs or functionality. Replace calls to Node.js APIs with calls to the equivalent Deno APIs, and make any other necessary changes to adapt the code to Deno's built-in types and functionality.


3. Test the package to make sure that it works as expected in Deno. This may involve running the package's test suite, or writing additional test cases to ensure that all of the package's functionality is working correctly in Deno.This may involve running the package's test suite, or writing additional test cases to ensure that all of the package's functionality is working correctly in Deno.

4. Publish the adapted package to a package registry that is compatible with Deno, such as deno.land/x.

# Experimental solution


Npm specifiers are a new feature in Deno that allows you to import npm packages directly from the npm registry using the import statement. To use an npm package with a specifier, you can use a special syntax that includes the package name and version, such as import { readFileSync } from "https://deno.land/x/fs@v0.12.0/mod.ts".

Using npm specifiers has several advantages. It allows you to use npm packages in Deno without having to install them locally or use a package manager, and it allows you to easily manage the version of the package that you are using. However, **npm specifiers are still a work in progress and may not be fully stable yet.**

Another option for using npm packages in Deno is to use CDNs, or content delivery networks. Many npm packages are available on CDNs, and you can import them into Deno by specifying the URL of the package on the CDN. For example, you can use the import statement to import the lodash package from the unpkg CDN like this: 

> import { map } from "https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.17.15/map.js".

Using CDNs to import npm packages is a more established approach, but it has some drawbacks compared to using npm specifiers. CDN URLs can change over time, which can break your imports, and it can be more difficult to manage the version of the package that you are using.
